# Open-MyRTUs Project #
The **Open-MyRTUs Project**'s goal is to provide a clear and well-documented source code of _MyRTUs_. The target is the **knowledge** itself.

## Source Code ##
The **source code** is based on the _assembly code_ provided by _MyRTUs'_ binaries. The library has been _reverse code engineered_ and rewritten in **C Code** respecting as much as possible the original code.
